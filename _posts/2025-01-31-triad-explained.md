**Note:** The CIA Triad explained in blocks you can understand.

What is the **CIA triad**? The CIA triad stands for **confidentiality, integrity, and availability** (not the be confused with the organization)

As a cybersecurity professional, the CIA triad means:

**Confidentiality**, limited access to information/data. Only those with the correct permissions can access it. 

**Integrity**, making sure information/data has not changed or been tampered with.

**Availablity**, making sure the end user is able to access information/data when needed.
