**Note:** What are hackers? Let's jump into it!

When you think of hackers, most people think of malicious people behind a computer screen with masks on. Perhaps you also imagine a black screen with green ones-and-zeros moving around the screen as they type away in their dark and mysterious room. 

Our portrayal of hackers has remained the consistent throughout the years, but as time has passed, the word "hacker" has developed more and more layers! There are lots of types of hackers found on the Internet, and even some type of hackers you may not know about.

In today's mini-lesson, I talk about the different types of hackers and what they do. Today's world is filled with **ethical hackers** (white-hat hackers), **unethical hackers** (black-hat hackers), and a combination of them both known as **grey-hat hackers**.

Ethical hackers, better known as **white-hat hackers**, are hackers who ask for permission to hack into computers, networks, and applications. In many cases, companies and organizations hire white-hat hackers to fix and point out vulnerabilities in their systems before the black-hat hackers get to them. White-hat hackers use similar tools and skills to black-hat hackers. There have been many cases of black-hat hackers turning the page and becoming white-hat hackers, still using their impressive skills but for good. 

Unethical hackers, better known as **black-hat hackers**
