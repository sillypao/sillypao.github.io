### Who Am I?

My name is Paola and I created Safe Internet 4 Me as a passion project during my cybersecurity studies! 

This website was created for students, by students. The main goal of this website was to make cybersecurity and digital safety resources easy to access and understand. This website hosts some resources that have helped me, on top of resources that I have created on my own. Thank you so much for visiting and stay tuned as I post more. :)

### Educational Background
 - Cybersecurity student soon to graduate with AAS in Cybersecurity
